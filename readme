To use:
1. initialize your config.json by filling in the various IDs; You can rename config example.json for this purpose and fill in the fields.
    -Prefix is the prefix symbol for your bot commands, by default it will be ! but you can change it here.
    I haven't tested with emoji or other nonstandard characters, but any unicode should work.
    -authtoken is your server's auth token !!do not share this with anyone!!
    -ServerID is the server ID.
2. run bot.js (typically, 'node bot.js' will be enough)

Currently, no commands are implemented. This will change; however it will pin items with 5 pin reactions on them,
and DM a copy of a message to you if you react to it with :bookmark:

Dependencies: discord.js, fs (module for node.js)
